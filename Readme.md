# Lab 4: Automated Training and Metric Reporting Using GitHub Actions

This lab introduces CI-driven machine learning workflows using GitHub Actions.
For each modification in model code for each experiment, push changes to GitHub,

- Compute evaluation metrics
- Display metrics in the GitHub Actions Job Summary
- Store trained models and results as workflow artifacts
